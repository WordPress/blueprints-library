# WordPress Blueprints

Blueprints are JSON files used to create WordPress sites with specific settings, themes, plugins, content, and anything
else that can be configured in WordPress. Here's what a Blueprint looks like:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "akismet",
    "gutenberg"
  ],
  "themes": [
    "twentynineteen"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "blogname": "My Blog",
    "blogdescription": "Just another WordPress site",
    "permalink_structure": "/%postname%/"
  },
  "constants": {
    "WP_DEBUG": true,
    "WP_DEBUG_LOG": true
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": "runPHP",
      "content": "<?php require 'wp-load.php'; update_user_meta(1, 'test', 'value');"
    }
  ]
}
```

original [Getting started with Blueprints v1](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/blueprints-api/index)
page for more information.

## Let's build Version 2 of Blueprints together!

Blueprints were initially built in TypeScript
for [WordPress Playground](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/),
However, they [quickly proved useful for
WordPress in general](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/1025).

This repository explores
a [PHP-based version 2 of Blueprints](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/1025) that can be
used in any environment, be it a browser, Node.js, wp-cli, or a native PHP application. The plan is to create a robust,
useful tool that will eventually be merged into WordPress core.

Your feedback is not just welcome, but essential to the success of this project. Please:

* Share your thoughts and ideas in the [Blueprints v2 Specification](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints/issues/6)
  issue – or any other issue that interests you
* Start new discussions
* Propose changes through comments and pull requests

Your input and code contributions will help shape the future of Blueprints in WordPress.
in discussions.

# Technical bits

## Setting Up the Project Locally

To set up the WordPress/blueprints project locally, here's a few useful commands:

Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Once you have it, install the required dependencies via

```shell
composer install
```

### Run tests with

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```

### Run Blueprints in a variety of ways

#### using the PHP Blueprint builder:

```shell
 php examples/blueprint_compiling.php
```

#### using a string containg a Blueprint (in JSON):

```shell
 php examples/json_string_compiling.php
```

### Regenerate models files from JSON schema with

```shell
composer global require jane-php/json-schema
php src/WordPress/Blueprints/bin/autogenerate_models.php
```

## Building to .phar

The Blueprints library is distributed as a .phar library. To build the .phar file, install box:

```shell
composer global require humbug/box
```

And then run:

```shell
rm composer.lock
rm -rf vendor
COMPOSER=composer-web.json composer install --no-dev
rm -rf vendor/pimple/pimple/ext/
rm -rf vendor/symfony/*/*.md
rm -rf vendor/symfony/*/composer.json
rm -rf vendor/symfony/*/*.dist
rm -rf vendor/*/*/LICENSE
box compile
```

Note that in box.json, the `"check-requirements"` option is set to `false`. Somehow, keeping it as `true` results in a
.phar file
that breaks HTTP requests in Playground. @TODO: Investigate why this is the case.

To try the built .phar file, run:

```shell
rm -rf new-wp/* && USE_PHAR=1 php blueprint_compiling.php
```

## PHP 7.0 Compatibility

This project is compatible with PHP >= 7.0.

Part of the process is automated with [rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector),
which transpiles the features added in PHP 7.1 and later to PHP 7.0.

There's also a manual part, to remove unsupported features using regexps.

### Automated part

To transpile the code to PHP 7.1, run:

```bash
php vendor/bin/rector process src
```

Unfortunately, Rector does not support downgrading to PHP 7.0 yet, so we need to do the
last stretch manually.

### Manual part

Rector will downgrade PHP code to PHP 7.1 but not further. We need PHP 7.0 compat
so here's a few additional regexps to run. Regexps are not, of course, reliable in
the general case, but they seem to do the trick here.

List of manual replacements

* `: \?[a-zA-Z_0-9]+` -> (empty string) to remove the unsupported return type
  from `function(): ?SchemaResolver {}` -> `function() {}`.
* `: iterable` to fix `Fatal error: Generators may only declare a return type of Generator, Iterator or Traversable`.
* `\?[a-zA-Z_0-9]+ \$` -> `$` to remove the unsupported nullable type from function signatures,
  e.g. `function(?Schema $schema){}` -> `function($schema){}`.
* `(protected|public|private) const` -> `const` as const visibility is not supported in PHP 7.0.
* `: void` -> `` as `void` return type is unsupported in PHP 7.0.

@TODO:

* `[$ns, $name] = $this->parseName($name);` -> `list($ns, $name) = $this->parseName($name);`
* `foreach ($data as [$cp, $chars]) {` -> `foreach ($data as list($cp, $chars)) {`
* Find or write Rector rules for downgrading to PHP 7.0
