## Opis JSON Schema valiation for PHP 7.0

This is a version of the [Opis](https://opis.io/json-schema/2.x/) JSON Schema validator that is compatible with PHP 7.0.

Opis seems to be the most complete and well-maintained JSON Schema validator for PHP. However,
Blueprints aim for PHP 7.0+ support and Opis is not compatible with PHP 7.0. Therefore, it was
transpiled to PHP 7.0 with [rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) and provided with this
repo.
