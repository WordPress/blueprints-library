/**
 * The ProgressTracker class is a tool for tracking progress in an operation that is
 * divided into multiple stages. It allows you to create sub-trackers for each stage,
 * with individual weights and captions. The main tracker automatically calculates the
 * progress based on the weighted sum of each sub-tracker's progress. This makes it easy
 * to keep track of a complex, multi-stage process and report progress in a user-friendly way.
 *
 * After creating the sub-trackers, you can call the set() method to update the progress
 * of the current stage. You can also call the finish() method to mark the current stage
 * as complete and move on to the next one. Alternatively, you can call the fillSlowly()
 * method to simulate progress filling up slowly to 100% before calling finish().
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const tracker = new ProgressTracker();
 * tracker.addEventListener('progress', (e) => {
 *        console.log(
 *                e.detail.progress,
 *                e.detail.caption
 *        );
 * });
 *
 * const stage1 = tracker.stage(0.5, 'Calculating pi digits');
 * const stage2 = tracker.stage(0.5, 'Downloading data');
 *
 * stage1.fillSlowly();
 * await calc100DigitsOfPi();
 * stage1.finish();
 *
 * await fetchWithProgress(function onProgress(loaded, total) {
 *        stage2.set( loaded / total * 100);
 * });
 * stage2.finish();

	/**
	 * Creates a new sub-tracker with a specific weight.
	 *
	 * The weight determines what percentage of the overall progress
	 * the sub-tracker represents. For example, if the main tracker is
	 * monitoring a process that has two stages, and the first stage
	 * is expected to take twice as long as the second stage, you could
	 * create the first sub-tracker with a weight of 0.67 and the second
	 * sub-tracker with a weight of 0.33.
	 *
	 * The caption is an optional string that describes the current stage
	 * of the operation. If provided, it will be used as the progress caption
	 * for the sub-tracker. If not provided, the main tracker will look for
	 * the next sub-tracker with a non-empty caption and use that as the progress
	 * caption instead.
	 *
	 * Returns the newly-created sub-tracker.
	 *
	 * @param weight The weight of the new stage, as a decimal value between 0 and 1.
	 * @param caption The caption for the new stage, which will be used as the progress caption for the sub-tracker.
	 *
	 * @throws {Error} If the weight of the new stage would cause the total weight of all stages to exceed 1.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```ts
	 * const tracker = new ProgressTracker();
	 * const subTracker1 = tracker.stage(0.67, 'Slow stage');
	 * const subTracker2 = tracker.stage(0.33, 'Fast stage');
	 *
	 * subTracker2.set(50);
	 * subTracker1.set(75);
	 * subTracker2.set(100);
	 * subTracker1.set(100);
